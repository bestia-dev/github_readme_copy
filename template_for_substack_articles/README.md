# bestia.dev/substack_articles

It looks like that google search is really bad for substack articles.  
Maybe it will work better as HTML files on my own domain.
For now it looks that SEO is better on non-platform domains.
Maybe it needs some more information for SEO. We will see.
On every HTML there is a link to bestia.dev and a link to the original substack article.
