## Motivation

It looks like google search SEO is really bad for github README.md files.  
Maybe it will work better as HTML files on my own domain. Yes, it does.  
On every README HTML, there is a link to bestia.dev and a link to the github repository.  
I need a utility CLI that copies the README files as they are rendered on github and save them as html files in the directory `copied_readme`.  
Then I will use an `rsync` command to upload the files to my google cloud virtual machine.

## Octocrab

I will use the crate `octocrab` to get a list of my public repos.  
You need to have a [github PAT (personal access token)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and save it in a environment variable:  

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_111111111111111111111
```
