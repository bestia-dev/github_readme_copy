# bestia.dev/github_readme

It looks like that google search is really bad for GitHub readme.  
Maybe it will work better as HTML files on my own domain.
For now it looks that SEO is better on non-platform domains.
Maybe it needs some more information for SEO. We will see.
On every HTML there is a link to bestia.dev and a link to the GitHub repository.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
