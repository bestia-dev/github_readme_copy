Hashtags: #rustlang #tutorial  
My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Motivation

It looks like google search SEO is really bad for GitHub README.md files.  
Maybe it will work better as HTML files on my own domain. Yes, it does.  
On every README HTML, there is a link to bestia.dev and a link to the GitHub repository.  
I need a utility CLI that copies the README files as they are rendered on GitHub and save them as html files in the directory `github_readme`.  
Then I will use an `rsync` command to upload the files to my google cloud virtual machine.

## Octocrab

I will use the crate `octocrab` to get a list of my public repos.  
You need to have a [GitHub PAT (personal access token)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and save it in a environment variable:  

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_111111111111111111111
```

## Workspaces with Primary project

When a project is a workspace with multiple projects, one of those is the primary project. We want to make a copy of this primary README.md and not of the workspace README.md. We can signal this to `github_readme_copy` with this link:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/bestia-dev/cargo_crev_reviews_workspace/tree/main/cargo_crev_reviews">Primary project README.md</a>
```

Example: <https://github.com/bestia-dev/cargo_crev_reviews_workspace>

## substack

I want to copy also the articles from substack to my domain web page. If anything happens to substack I will have a backup.  

```bash
github_readme_copy substack bestiadev
```

## TODO

Use github encoded oauth2 instead of env variable

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
